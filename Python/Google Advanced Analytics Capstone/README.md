# Project Title
Employee Turnover Prediction Using Machine Learning Models

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict employee turnover in a large consulting firm using machine learning models. The analysis utilizes data on employee characteristics, job satisfaction levels, work history, and performance metrics to identify factors contributing to employee turnover and develop predictive models. Random Forest and Gradient Boosting algorithms outperformed the Decision Tree model, achieving accuracies of over 96%. The project provides valuable insights for the HR department to prioritize retention efforts and improve employee satisfaction levels.

## Business Understanding
The HR department of a consulting firm faces challenges in retaining employees and reducing turnover rates. High turnover can lead to increased recruitment costs, loss of talent, and decreased productivity. By predicting employee turnover and identifying contributing factors, the HR department can implement targeted retention strategies to improve employee satisfaction and reduce turnover rates.

## Data Understanding
The analysis utilizes a dataset containing information on employee characteristics, job satisfaction levels, work history, and performance metrics. The data span a specific timeframe and include variables such as satisfaction level, number of projects, time spent at the company, promotion status, department, and salary. Exploratory data analysis reveals insights into the distribution of variables and potential correlations with employee turnover.

## Modeling and Evaluation
The project employs machine learning models, including Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, to predict employee turnover. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess model performance. Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models demonstrate superior predictive accuracy and effectiveness in identifying employees at risk of leaving the company.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, recommendations for the HR department include prioritizing retention efforts for employees identified as high-risk based on model predictions and implementing initiatives to improve job satisfaction and provide career advancement opportunities. Future steps may involve validating model predictions with real-world data, refining model features, and exploring additional factors influencing turnover rates.
