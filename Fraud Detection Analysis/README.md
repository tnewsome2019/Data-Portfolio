# Fraud Detection with Feature Selection and Predictive Modeling

## Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using a credit card transactions dataset. The analysis includes data exploration, feature selection, predictive modeling, and visualization of model performance.

## Objectives
- Identify key features that correlate with fraudulent transactions.
- Build and evaluate a predictive model for fraud detection.
- Visualize the performance of the model and the importance of selected features.

## Tools
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Results
- Identified key features such as `ratio_to_median_purchase_price`, `distance_from_home`, and `online_order`.
- Built a logistic regression model with an accuracy of 96%.
- Visualized the importance of selected features and the model's performance metrics.

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `Fraud-Detection-Feature-Selection` directory.
3. Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
