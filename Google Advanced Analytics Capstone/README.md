# Salifort Motors Employee Turnover Prediction Using Machine Learning Models

## The Story

Employee retention is a critical challenge for many organizations. At Salifort Motors, high turnover rates were leading to increased recruitment costs and loss of talent. This project aims to predict employee turnover using machine learning models, providing insights to help the HR department implement effective retention strategies.

## Objectives
- Predict employee turnover using machine learning.
- Identify factors contributing to turnover.
- Provide actionable insights to improve employee retention.

## Tools
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)

## The Journey

### Business Understanding
The HR department needed a way to foresee which employees might leave, to mitigate the high costs associated with turnover. By predicting turnover and understanding the contributing factors, Salifort Motors can focus on improving job satisfaction and retention.

### Data Understanding
I utilized a dataset containing employee characteristics, job satisfaction levels, work history, and performance metrics. Exploratory data analysis revealed patterns and correlations, setting the stage for our predictive models.

### Modeling and Evaluation
I employed Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models. Evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used to assess performance. Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models outperformed the Decision Tree, achieving over 96% accuracy.

### Results
- Identified key factors influencing employee turnover.
- Developed high-accuracy predictive models.
- Provided actionable recommendations for the HR department.

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `Salifort-Motors-Employee-Turnover` directory.
3. Run the Python scripts to preprocess data and train models.
4. Explore the results and visualizations in the provided notebooks.

## Conclusion
This project provided valuable insights into employee turnover at Salifort Motors. By using predictive models, the HR department can focus on high-risk employees and implement strategies to improve retention and satisfaction, ensuring a more stable and productive workforce.
